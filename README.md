# Cheap Flights Finder

Web app that finds the **cheapest direct flight** and the **cheapest flight with at most
2 stops** (stopover ≤ 3 hours) between two cities/airports for a vacation of a given length.
Supports country inputs (expands to that country's commercial airports), flexible date
windows, stay-length ranges, open-jaw (different return airport), and an optional
**direct-only (nonstop)** filter. Every result lists the **outbound and the return** flight
(airport, `dd.mm.yyyy` date, times, airline) plus the number of stay days.

**Live flight prices. Completely static. No backend, no accounts, no API keys, no credit card.**
It runs entirely in the browser on GitHub Pages.

## How it works (no server!)

GitHub Pages can only serve static files, and a browser can't fetch Google Flights directly
(CORS + it's a JavaScript app). So instead:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your browser (GitHub Pages)                                     │
│                                                                  │
│  1. resolve city/country → IATA          (client-side)           │
│  2. build Google Flights' ?tfs= query     (protobuf encoder)      │
│  3. ask a public "reader" to render the   ──────► r.jina.ai       │
│     Google Flights results page                    (free, keyless)│
│  4. parse prices from the returned HTML   (flight parser)         │
│  5. render the tables                     (client-side)           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything runs in `docs/app.js`. It is a self-contained JavaScript port of the
[`fast-flights`](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/flights) library:

- **Protobuf encoder** — builds the `?tfs=` parameter Google Flights expects
  (byte-identical to the Python library; verified against known values).
- **Reader fetch** — asks a public reader service (`https://r.jina.ai/`, free and
  key-less) to fetch and render the Google Flights results page server-side, so CORS and
  Google's JavaScript don't matter. The reader returns the rendered HTML with CORS enabled.
  The same query works on any Google domain, so if the reader blocks one
  (e.g. *"anonymous access to www.google.com blocked"*), the app automatically tries the
  next domain in `FLIGHT_GOOGLE_HOSTS` until it gets real flight data.
- **Parser** — extracts the flight data (`AF_initDataCallback` / `ds:1` payload) from that
  HTML and maps it to itineraries, prices and airlines. It reads **every** itinerary list in
  the payload (the nonstop list *and* the connecting/"best" list), because the cheapest flight
  is frequently only in one of them (the `fast-flights` library reads just one, so it can miss
  the cheapest). Verified to produce the same results as the Python library, plus the cheaper
  options it misses.

> **No secret is embedded and nothing is exposed.** The reader request and the (already
> public) Google Flights page are the only network calls.

## Use it

Open the GitHub Pages URL, type a country/city/airport, pick your dates and stay, and search.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

The included workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` deploys `docs/` on every push to
`main`. In the repository go to **Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"**.

Your site is live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Configuration (all optional)

`docs/config.js`:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLIGHT_READER` | `https://r.jina.ai/` | The reader/fetcher prefix. |
| `FLIGHT_READER_KEY` | `""` | Optional reader API key — only **raises rate limits**; never required. |
| `FLIGHT_GOOGLE_HOSTS` | `["www.google.co.uk", "www.google.ca", …]` | Google domains tried in order until real flight data is returned. |
| `MAX_SEARCHES` | `12` | Max route/date lookups per search (a round trip uses one lookup for the outbound plus one for the return, de-duplicated). |
| `SEARCH_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | How many reader requests run at once. |
| `SEARCH_TIME_BUDGET_MS` | `90000` | Give up and show partial results after this long. |

Visitors can override the reader, add their own key, or change the lookup cap from the in-page
**⚙️ Data source settings** panel (saved in their browser only).

## Local development

Any static server works — there is no build step:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Limitations

- **No official Google Flights API exists.** This uses a public reader to render the same
  page a browser would, then parses it. Google may occasionally show a consent/verification
  page, and the free reader is rate-limited or may block a given Google domain for a while —
  the app reports both clearly and falls back to other Google domains. Retrying usually works.
- **Sampled, not exhaustive (unless you ask).** To respect the free reader, the date window
  (max 31 days) is normally sampled and the number of lookups is capped (`MAX_SEARCHES`).
  Choose **"Every day in window"** to check each calendar day for the primary route instead
  (more requests — raise the lookup cap accordingly). Country inputs expand to the main
  commercial airports, capped as well.
- **Round-trip detail.** Google's round-trip page returns its round-trip total price but lists
  only the **outbound** itinerary. The app therefore fetches the **return direction separately**
  (one extra lookup per return date, de-duplicated) and shows the cheapest return on that date
  for the same airline when available. The price shown is always Google's own round-trip total.
  Open-jaw totals are estimated from two separate one-ways.
- **Every flight shows both directions** in a fixed order: departure airport → departure date →
  departure &amp; arrival time → airline → stay days (outbound), then the same for the return.
  All dates are shown as `dd.mm.yyyy`.
- **Direct-only.** Tick *Direct flights only (nonstop)* to restrict every lookup (outbound and
  return) to nonstop itineraries.
- Prices are live estimates only — not bookable through this app.
- City resolution works best for major cities; prefer IATA codes (JFK, LHR, CDG, …) for
  reliability.

## Optional: self-hosted Python backend (legacy)

Earlier versions of this app used a Flask backend (`app.py`) that scrapes Google Flights with
`fast-flights` and serves JSON over CORS. That path still works if you prefer to run your own
backend (Docker, Vercel, a VPS, …) — see `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` and `vercel.json` —
but it is **no longer required**: the GitHub Pages app above is fully self-contained.

## Example

- From: `New York` or `JFK`
- To: `London` or `LHR`
- Vacation days: `7`
- Optional departure date
